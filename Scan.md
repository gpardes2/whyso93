Checkmarx scan refers to the process of using the Checkmarx Application Security Testing (AST) tool to analyze and identify security vulnerabilities in the source code of applications. Checkmarx specializes in Static Application Security Testing (SAST), which means it examines the application's source code without executing the application itself.

During a Checkmarx scan, the tool thoroughly analyzes the codebase to discover potential security flaws, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. It checks for issues such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and many other security risks. By performing static code analysis, Checkmarx can help identify these vulnerabilities early in the development process, allowing developers to address them before the application is deployed.

The process of conducting a Checkmarx scan typically involves the following steps:

1. Source Code Submission: The application's source code is provided to the Checkmarx tool, either directly or through integration with a version control system (such as Git).

2. Code Analysis: Checkmarx scans the source code, reviewing every line for potential security issues. It examines the code's flow, data handling, and interactions to identify security vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Detection: The tool identifies security vulnerabilities, including potential weaknesses, bugs, and risky code patterns.

4. Severity Assessment: Checkmarx assigns a severity level to each identified vulnerability based on its potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

5. Reporting: The results of the scan are presented in a detailed report, highlighting the vulnerabilities found, their severity, and recommendations for remediation.

6. Remediation: Developers review the scan results and work on fixing the identified vulnerabilities in the codebase.

7. Re-Scan (Optional): After the remediation, developers may conduct another scan to verify that the security issues have been adequately addressed.

Using Checkmarx and other similar security scanning tools is crucial in ensuring that applications are secure and less prone to cyberattacks. It is a proactive approach to improving the security posture of software and reducing the likelihood of potential breaches and data leaks.
