Jenkins Pipeline is a powerful and flexible way to define continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows in Jenkins. It allows you to define your build, test, and deployment processes as code, providing better visibility, maintainability, and reusability of your CI/CD pipelines.

There are two main types of Jenkins Pipelines:

1. Scripted Pipeline: It uses Groovy scripting syntax to define the CI/CD workflow. This approach provides more freedom and flexibility but can be more verbose.

2. Declarative Pipeline: It uses a more structured and opinionated syntax, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain. It follows a specific set of rules and predefined steps, making it less error-prone.

Here's a simple example of a Declarative Jenkins Pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Your build steps go here
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Your test steps go here
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Your deployment steps go here
                sh 'docker build -t myapp .'
                sh 'docker run -d -p 8080:8080 myapp'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            // Actions to perform when the pipeline succeeds
            echo 'Pipeline succeeded!'
        }
        failure {
            // Actions to perform when the pipeline fails
            echo 'Pipeline failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the pipeline has three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. Each stage contains steps that are executed when the pipeline runs. After the pipeline completes, the `post` block is executed, where you can define actions to be taken based on the pipeline's success or failure.

To create a Jenkins Pipeline, you can use the Jenkins web interface to create a new pipeline job and provide the Jenkinsfile containing the pipeline definition. Alternatively, you can also define the pipeline in a source code repository and configure Jenkins to read the Jenkinsfile from there.

Jenkins Pipelines offer a lot of flexibility and support various integrations with version control systems, build tools, testing frameworks, and deployment platforms. It is an essential part of modern CI/CD practices and allows teams to automate and streamline their software development and delivery processes.
